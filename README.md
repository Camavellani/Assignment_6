This is a helpful video about the basics of the unittest framework in Python that is used for automated testing. The code that I used to follow along is uploaded as "unittest_practice.py" in this repository under the "unittest Practice" branch.

I uploaded a different student class called "test_student_class.py" with a modified version of the add_course method to make it easier to run an automated test with the unittest framework. My unit test file is called "test_student.py". See if you can follow along with what I've done and apply it to your other classes.
